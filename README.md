### Hi there ðŸ˜„ I'm Alessio!

I'm an applied mathematician who likes to play with machine leanring and data!

Currently I'm a research assistant at the [Automatic Control Laboratory](https://control.ee.ethz.ch/) of ETH ZÃ¼rich!
I'm mostly working on data driven optimal control algorithms and reinforcement learning agents for smart cities!
